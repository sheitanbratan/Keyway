# G-code generator for keyway broaching on Doosan Lynx/Puma CNC machine with Fanuc control.
Just enter your parameters for keyway broaching, and you will have a complete program. You only need to change the tool number in the program and set a new program name. Additionally, if you need to create more than one keyway in your part, you can use the "from file mode". The program will ask you for the path to a .txt file with a list of angles for the keyways. An example of this file is also in the repository.
